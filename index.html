                            <h2>UI DESIGN</h2>
                            <p> User interfaces are the interfaces that allow people to engage with designs. The purpose of user interface design is to make the user's interaction as easy and efficient as feasible.  I primarily emphasize information architecture using user interface design. I follow theÂ process of creating interfaces using user interface design with the correct selection of color palette, typeface, font size, etc. to express what is essential to the user.</p>

                            <h2>UX DESIGN</h2>
                            <p>User experience design is the experience that a user would get through when interacting with a product. Instead than relying on aesthetic tastes and views, I use research, data analysis, and test results to drive my UX design decisions. When I am designing the user experience of any product, user research allows me to understand the concerns that certain consumers have.</p>
